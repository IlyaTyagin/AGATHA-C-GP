# Replicate 2015 Validation Experiments

In [our paper][paper_link] we present state-of-the-art performance numbers
across a range of recent biomedical discoveries across popular biomedical
sub-domains. We trained the Agatha system using only data published prior to
2015, and supply the necessary subset of that data in an easy-to-replicate
package. Note, the full release is also available for those wishing to tinker
further. Here's how to get started.

Setup a conda environment

```
conda create -n agatha python=3.8
conda activate agatha
```

Install PyTorch. We need a version >= 1.4, but different systems will require
different cuda library versions. We installed PyTorch using this command:

```
conda install pytorch cudatoolkit=9.2 -c pytorch
```

Install Agatha. This comes along with the dependencies necessary to run the
pretrained model.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/JSybrandt/agatha.git
```


Now we can download the 2015 hypothesis prediction subset. We recommend the tool
`gdown` that comes along with Agatha to download our 38.5GB
file. If you don't want to use that tool, you can download the same file from
your browser via [this link][2015_model_link].

```
# Remeber where you place your file
cd <AGATHA_DATA_DIR>
# This will place 2015_hypothesis_predictor_512.tar.gz in AGATHA_DATA_DIR
gdown --id 1Tka7zPF0PdG7yvGOGOXuEsAtRLLimXmP
# Unzip the download
tar -zxvf 2015_hypothesis_predictor_512.tar.gz
```

We can now load the Agatha model in python. After loading, we need to inform the
model of where it can find its helper data. By default it looks in the current
working directory.

```python3
import torch
torch.load(<AGATHA_DATA_DIR>/model.pt)
```

# Installing Agatha for Development

These instructions are useful if you want to customize Agatha, especially if you
are also running this system on the Clemson Palmetto Cluster. This guide
also assumes that you have already installed `anaconda3`.

Step zero. Get yourself a node made in the last few years with a decent GPU.
Currently supported GPU's on palmetto include the `P100` and the `V100`. Recent
changes to pytorch are incompatible with older models.

The recommended node request is:
```
qsub -I -l select=5:ncpus=40:mem=365gb:ngpus=2:gpu_model=v100,walltime=72:00:00
```

First, load the following modules:
```
module load gcc/8.3.0          \
            cuDNN/9.2v7.2.1    \
            sqlite/3.21.0      \
            cuda-toolkit/9.2   \
            nccl/2.4.2-1       \
            hdf5/1.10.5        \
            mpc/0.8.1
```

Second, setup an anaconda environment for Agatha:
```
conda create -n agatha python=3.8
conda activate agatha
```

Third, install pytorch. Note, because of limitations on palmetto, you're going
to need to stick with the cudatoolkit 9.2 version.
```
conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=9.2 -c pytorch
```

Fourth, we can clone and install the _full_ version of Agatha.
```
# Downloads agatha source
git clone https://github.com/JSybrandt/agatha.git
cd agatha
# Installs the agatha module
pip install -e .
# Installs the developer requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you should be ready to roll! I recommend you create the following file
somewhere like `~/prep_agatha_env`:

```
# Remove current modules (if any)
module purge
# Leave current conda env (if any)
conda deactivate
# Load all nessesary palmetto modules
module load gcc/8.3.0 mpc/0.8.1 cuda-toolkit/9.2 cuDNN/9.2v7.2.1 nccl/2.4.2-1 \
            sqlite/3.21.0 hdf5/1.10.5
# Include hdf5, needed to build tools
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH:/software/hdf5/1.10.5/include
# Load python modules
conda activate agatha
```

You can then switch to your agatha environment, with modules loaded, by running:
```
source ~/prep_agatha_env
```
